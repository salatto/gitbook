# What is Salatto

**Salatto** is a next-generation lottery & gaming platform that allows **any creator** to launch transparent, provably fair lotteries and instant games, while **players** can participate in games they trust, understand, and enjoy.

Salatto is not just a gambling product — it is a **community-run lotto marketplace**.

#### Why Salatto Exists

Traditional lottery platforms:

* are centralized
* hide mechanics and real odds
* do not reward creators
* lock users into opaque systems
* impose rigid, outdated payout structures
* stretch payouts over 10–20+ years instead of paying winners instantly
* force public disclosure of winners, removing privacy

In traditional lotteries, even a **"win"** often means:

* receiving only part of the advertised jackpot
* waiting decades for full payout
* losing anonymity
* having no control or transparency over the process

> Salatto was created to solve these problems.

Salatto was created to:

* make lotteries **transparent**, **understandable**, and **verifiable**
* eliminate payout **blocks**, **delays**, and **artificial restrictions**
* align incentives between **players**, **creators**, and the **platform**
* let users clearly see **what they buy**, **what they can win**, **and why**
* ensure full and **instant payouts** based on clearly defined rules
* give creators **tools, not permissions**
* remove forced **jackpot splitting** unless explicitly defined by the creator
* allow **winners** to remain **anonymous** by default

#### Core Idea

> If you understand the game — you trust the game.

**Salatto** is built around clarity, verifiable fairness, and creator freedom.
