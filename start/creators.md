### Creator Guide

Creating a game on Salatto is designed to be simple, transparent, and fully creator-controlled. You define the idea and economics — the platform handles execution, fairness, and payouts.

**Step 1 — Connect Your Wallet**

Connect your Solana wallet to access creator features.

* Click **Log in** in the top-right corner
* Approve the wallet connection

Your wallet acts as your creator identity and payout destination.

**Step 2 — Open the Game Creator**

Navigate to the game creation interface.

* Click **Create Game**
* Choose the type of game you want to launch

This is where your lottery or instant game is configured.

**Step 3 — Define Game Rules**

Set the core parameters of your game:

* prize type and prize amount
* ticket price
* total number of tickets or participants
* game duration and completion conditions

All rules are locked before launch and cannot be changed once the game is live.

Once published, your game becomes immediately available to players.

#### Who Can Become a Creator

* passes basic platform requirements
