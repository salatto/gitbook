# Quickstart

Get started with Salatto in just a few minutes. No prior lottery or Web3 experience is required.

**Step 1 — Visit Salat.to** <a href="https://salat.to/" class="button primary" data-icon="ticket">Visit</a>

Go to the Salatto application to explore games or start creating your own.

* Open the official Salat.to website
* No installation required — Salatto runs directly in your browser

From here, you can browse live games, view rules and odds, or continue to onboarding.

**Step 2 — Connect Your Wallet**

To play or create games, connect a Solana-supported wallet.

* Click **Log in** in the top-right corner
* Approve the wallet connection

Your wallet is used for participation, winnings, and creator payouts.

**Step 3 — Choose Your Path**

Once connected, you can:

* **Play** — join existing lotteries and games
* **Create** — launch your own game as a creator

Salatto adapts the interface based on how you choose to participate.

***

Salatto represents a shift from **operator-controlled lotteries** to **creator-owned game economies**.
