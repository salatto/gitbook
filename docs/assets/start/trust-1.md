# Security & Trust

Trust is the foundation of any lottery platform. Salatto is built so that trust is not required — it is **verifiable**.

***

#### Provably Fair Draws

Every draw on Salatto is on-chain and verifiable.

**VRF Technology:** Salatto uses a Verifiable Random Function to generate randomness for all game outcomes. This ensures that no one — including platform developers, lottery creators, or any third party — can predict or manipulate the result of a draw.

**How to verify:**

1. Open any completed game
2. Click on the draw transaction link
3. Inspect the VRF output and winner selection on-chain

The math is public. The results are deterministic. Anyone can verify.

***

#### Automated, Immutable Execution

* **Automated payouts** — winners receive funds directly to their wallets without manual intervention
* **Immutable game logic** — once a game is published, its rules cannot be changed
* **No manual overrides** — Salatto cannot alter outcomes, block payouts, or modify game parameters after launch
* **Transparent rules** — every game's mechanics, odds, and prize structure are visible before participation

***

#### Non-Custodial by Design

Salatto does not hold user funds outside of active game participation.

* Your wallet remains under your control at all times
* Funds are locked in game contracts only during active participation
* Winnings are distributed directly to your wallet

**Salatto will never ask for:**

* Your private keys or seed phrase
* Direct token transfers outside the platform
* Access to your wallet beyond standard transaction approvals

If anyone asks for these — it is a scam.

***

#### Creator Reputation System

Not all creators are equal. Salatto provides tools to help players assess creator reliability:

* **Creator Rating (CR) Soon!** — an overall trust score based on a creator's history, completion rates, and player feedback
* **Death Games Rate (DG) Soon!**  — the percentage of a creator's games that ended in refund rather than a successful draw

A high CR and low DG indicate a reliable creator. Players are encouraged to check these metrics before participating.

***

#### Odds, RTP & Economics

Salatto operates with full economic transparency:

* **RTP per game type** — disclosed before participation and locked at launch
* **Expected odds** — clearly shown for every game
* **Platform fee** — 5% from successful games only
* **Creator margin** — set by the creator and visible

There is no hidden house edge. The economics of every game are visible and auditable.

***

#### Security Practices

* Smart contract audits — planned (details will be published when completed)
* Bug bounty program — coming soon
* Vulnerability reporting — contact the team via Support

***

#### What Salatto Cannot Do

* Manipulate draw outcomes
* Block or delay legitimate payouts
* Change game rules after publication
* Access your wallet or private keys
* Reverse completed transactions

The platform is designed so that even Salatto itself cannot interfere with fair game execution.
