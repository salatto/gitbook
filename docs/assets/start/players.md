# For Players (Users)

> Players are users who browse, participate in, and win prizes from lotteries and games on Salatto. No blockchain expertise is required — the platform is designed to be accessible to everyone.

***

#### How to Play

1. **Connect your wallet** — click **Log in** and approve the wallet connection
2. **Browse available games** — explore live lotteries, upcoming games, and instant games
3. **Open a game page** — review all details before participating:
   * Ticket price
   * Prize pool and distribution
   * Total number of tickets
   * Lottery progress (tickets sold / remaining)
   * Creator info and reputation
4. **Buy ticket(s)** — confirm the transaction in your wallet
5. **Wait for the draw** — or get an instant result, depending on the game type
6. **Receive winnings automatically** — prizes are sent directly to your wallet

***

#### Types of Games

**Classic Lotteries** — buy tickets, wait for the draw, win based on provably fair randomness. The most common game type on Salatto.

**Jackpot Pool** — a shared prize pool that grows across multiple games. Monthly draws with larger prizes. _(Coming soon)_

**Creator-Exclusive Games** — unique game formats designed by individual creators with custom rules and prize structures. _(Coming soon)_

***

#### Understanding Odds

Every game on Salatto shows:

* **Total tickets** in the game
* **Winning tickets** and prize tiers
* **Your percentage chance** of winning

Before buying a ticket, you always know:

* The **maximum you can lose** (your ticket price)
* The **maximum you can win** (the top prize)
* The **exact odds** of each outcome

There are no hidden mechanics. What you see is what you get.

***

#### Early Exit

Changed your mind after buying a ticket? You can sell it back before the draw completes.

**Early exit fee: 15%**

This fee compensates for the disruption to the game's liquidity and economics. It protects both the creator and other participants.

Buy tickets thoughtfully. DYOR before participating.

***

#### Refunds

If a lottery fails to meet its requirements (e.g., minimum participants not reached), the game status changes to **Refunded** and funds are returned to all participants automatically. A small Solana network fee may apply.

***

#### Rank Progression&#x20;

Salatto uses a **rank progression system** to reflect a user’s activity on the platform.\
Your rank is based on **how many games you have participated in** and is currently displayed in the **My Tickets** section.

***

### Rank Levels

| Rank                                                        | Games Played |

| **Beginner**                                                | **0–10**     |

* No direct rewards or advantages yet
* Used mainly for **visual status and progress tracking**

***

### Future Evolution

**Ranks** are informational and visual — used for status and progress tracking. No direct rewards or gameplay advantages are tied to ranks **yet**.

> The rank system will evolve as Salatto grows.

**What's coming next:**
