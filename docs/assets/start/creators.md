# For Creators (Operators)

> **Creators** are independent users who design, launch, and promote lotteries and games on Salatto. They define the rules and economics — the platform handles execution, fairness, and payouts.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Creators** are not employees or partners of Salatto. They are **independent game publishers**.
{% endhint %}

***

#### Who Can Become a Creator

Anyone who:

* Connects a Solana wallet
* Passes basic platform requirements
* Agrees to platform rules and transparency standards

> There is no minimum audience size. Whether you have 100 followers or 1,000,000 — you can create a game.

***

### Creator Guide

Creating a game on Salatto is designed to be simple, transparent, and fully creator-controlled. You define the idea and economics — the platform handles execution, fairness, and payouts.

**Step 1 — Connect Your Wallet**

Connect your Solana wallet to access creator features.

* Click **Log in** in the top-right corner
* Approve the wallet connection

Your wallet acts as your creator identity and payout destination.

**Step 2 — Open the Game Creator**

Navigate to the game creation interface.

* Click **Create Game**
* Choose the type of game you want to launch

This is where your lottery or instant game is configured.

**Step 3 — Define Game Rules**

Configure the core parameters of your game:

* **Prize type and amount** — what winners receive
* **Ticket price** — cost per entry
* **Total number of tickets** — how many participants the game supports
* **Game duration** — time limit&#x20;

> All rules are locked before launch and cannot be changed once the game is live.

{% hint style="info" %}
Once published, your game becomes immediately available to players.
{% endhint %}

#### What Creators Control

Creators define:

* Game type and format
* Ticket price and total supply
* Prize pool&#x20;
* Creator margin (their earnings percentage)

Creator does NOT control:

* Randomness or winner selection
* Payout execution
* Game outcome in any way

> This separation ensures that every game is fair regardless of who created it.

#### Game Statuses

| Status         | What it means                                                              |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Active**     | The game is live and selling tickets. You can still buy or sell tickets.   |

| **Cencelled**  | The game did not meet minimum requirements. All ticket funds are refunded. |
| **Processing** | Ticket sales have ended. The VRF draw is being executed on-chain.          |

#### How Creators Earn

Creators earn a percentage of each successfully completed game. The exact creator margin is set during game creation and is visible to all participants.

Creators **do not earn** if:

* The game fails to reach minimum participation (refunded)
* Platform rules are violated

{% hint style="info" %}
The creator is solely responsible for promoting their lottery and undertakes to promote it.
{% endhint %}

#### Creators are users who:

* create lotteries or games
* define prize structures
* attract audiences
* earn from successful games up to 90% of successful game.

> Each creator independently determines their own game, but no less than 5% for the prize pool.

***

#### Creator Reputation System

Not all creators are equal. Salatto provides tools to help players assess creator reliability:

* **Creator Rating (CR) Soon!** — an overall trust score based on a creator's history, completion rates, and player feedback
* **Dead Games Rate (DG) Soon!**  — the percentage of a creator's games that ended in refund rather than a successful draw

A high CR and low DG indicate a reliable creator. Players are encouraged to check these metrics before participating.

***

#### Anti-Fraud Rules

Salatto enforces strict rules to protect players:

* Creators cannot manipulate randomness or outcomes
* Game parameters are immutable once published
* Suspicious patterns (self-play, coordinated abuse) are detected and flagged
* Violations result in penalties up to permanent platform ban

***

#### Creator FAQ

**Can I edit a game after publishing?** No. All game rules are locked at launch to ensure fairness and trust.

**What happens if my game doesn't sell out?** If minimum participation isn't reached, the game is refunded. All player funds are returned, and you earn nothing, and your **CR** is dropping.

**How much can I earn?** Your earnings depend on the creator margin you set (up to 90%) and the number of tickets sold. The platform takes a 5% fee from successful games.

**Do I need a large audience?** No. Games are discoverable on the Salatto marketplace. However, creators who actively promote their games in social media typically see better results.
