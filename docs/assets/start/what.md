# What is Salatto

**Salatto** is a decentralized lottery & gaming platform on Solana where **anyone can create** transparent, provably fair lotteries and instant games — and **anyone can play** with full confidence in the outcome.

Salatto is **not** a casino or gambling product. It is a **community-run lotto marketplace** — a new category we call **LottoFi**.

> All you need is a dollar and a dream. You **can't** win if you **don't** play.

#### Why Salatto Exists

Traditional lottery platforms are broken:

* They are **centralized** and opaque — players have no way to verify outcomes
* They **hide real odds** and mechanics behind fine print
* They **stretch payouts over 10–20+ years** instead of paying winners instantly
* They take **massive cuts through taxes and fees** — the $2B Mega MiIIions jackpot paid less than $1B after tax and lump-sum discount
* They **force public disclosure** of winners, removing privacy
* They **don't reward creators** or communities that drive participation

Even when you "**win**" a traditional lottery, you often receive only a fraction of the advertised prize, wait years for full payout, and lose your anonymity in the process.

> Salatto was built to fix this.

***

Salatto was created to:

* make lotteries **transparent**, **understandable**, and **verifiable**
* eliminate payout **blocks**, **delays**, and **artificial restrictions**
* align incentives between **players**, **creators**, and the **platform**
* let users clearly see **what they buy**, **what they can win**, **and why**
* ensure full and **instant payouts** based on clearly defined rules
* give creators **tools, not permissions**
* remove forced **jackpot splitting** unless explicitly defined by the creator
* allow **winners** to remain **anonymous** by default

***

#### Core Principles

> **If you understand the game — you trust the game.**

**Salatto** is built around three pillars:

* **Transparency** — every prize, chance, and ticket price is visible before you participate
* **Fairness** — outcomes are determined by on-chain VRF (Verifiable Random Function) that no one can manipulate
* **Creator freedom** — anyone can design and launch a own lottery, not just licensed operators

#### Key Advantages of Salatto Lotteries

* **Instant payouts** — winnings are distributed automatically, no waiting periods
* **No forced jackpot sharing** — prize rules are defined and locked before the game starts
* **Provably fair randomness** — on-chain VRF ensures outcomes cannot be manipulated by anyone, including Salatto
* **Winner anonymity** — your privacy is respected by default
* **Clear odds & RTP disclosure** — no hidden math, no surprises
* **Creator-defined mechanics** — creators design the game, the platform handles execution
* **Automated execution** — no human interference in draws or payouts
* **Non-custodial** — Salatto never holds your funds outside of active game participation
