# Why Salatto is different

## Why Salatto Is Different

Salatto is not another gambling dApp. It introduces a fundamentally different model for how lotteries work — one built on transparency, creator ownership, and decentralized infrastructure.

***

#### Salatto vs. Traditional Lotteries

| Feature                 | Traditional Lotteries                 | Salatto                              |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Transparency            | Opaque mechanics, hidden odds         | All rules and odds visible on-chain  |
| Payouts                 | 10–20+ year annuities, heavy tax cuts | Instant, full payouts to your wallet |
| Fairness                | "Trust us" — no way to verify         | Provably fair via on-chain VRF       |
| Privacy                 | Winners publicly disclosed            | Anonymous by default                 |
| Who can create          | Licensed operators only               | Anyone                               |
| Prize pool visibility   | Hidden until draw                     | Live and visible in real-time        |
| Fees & cuts             | 40–65% taken before payout            | 5% platform fee, transparent         |
| RTP (Return to Players) | 35–60%                                | Disclosed per game, creator-defined  |

#### Salatto vs. Online Casinos

Casinos and lotteries serve different needs. Casinos offer high-frequency, high-RTP games (93–97%) designed around session engagement. Lotteries offer low-frequency, high-reward games built around **hope** — the chance to change your life with a single ticket.

Salatto brings lottery economics on-chain with the transparency that crypto users expect, while keeping the experience accessible to non-crypto audiences.

#### What Makes Salatto Unique

**Creator-owned game economies.** Salatto shifts lotteries from operator-controlled systems to creator-driven marketplaces. Creators design, launch, and promote their own games — earning revenue from successful participation.

**LottoFi — a new vertical.** Salatto bridges traditional lottery mechanics with DeFi primitives. Tickets are no longer "dead" assets — the platform introduces liquidity, buyback mechanics, and on-chain settlement.

**No permission needed.** There are no gatekeepers. Any creator can launch a game, and any player can participate — as long as they meet basic platform requirements.

**Built on Solana.** Low fees, fast transactions, and on-chain VRF make Solana the ideal foundation for a lottery platform where ticket prices can start at $0.01 and less

***

#### The Bigger Picture

The global lottery market is **1.2× larger** than the entire gambling industry. Yet the lottery experience has barely changed in decades. Salatto is digitizing, decentralizing, and opening up this massive market — starting with crypto-native users and expanding outward.
