# Quickstart

Get started with Salatto in minutes. No prior lottery or Web3 experience required.

***

### **Step 1 — Visit Salat.to** <a href="https://salat.to/" class="button primary" data-icon="ticket">Visit</a>

Go to Salatto to explore games or start creating your own.

* Open the official Salat.to website
* No installation required — Salatto runs entirely in your browser

From here, you can browse live games, view rules and odds, or continue to onboarding.

***

### **Step 2 — Connect Your Wallet**

To play or create games, connect a Solana-supported wallet.

* Click **Log in** in the top-right corner
* Select your wallet provider (Phantom, Solflare, Backpack, etc.)
* Approve the connection

Your wallet is used for participation, winnings, and creator payouts.

Salatto never has access to your private keys.
{% endhint %}

***

### **Step 3 — Choose Your Path**

Once connected, you can:

* **Play** — join existing lotteries and games → Player Guide&#x20;
* **Create** — launch your own game as a creator → Player Guide

Salatto adapts the interface based on how you choose to participate.

***

#### What You Need

* A Solana-compatible wallet (Phantom, Solflare, Backpack, or any supported wallet)
* SOL or supported tokens for ticket purchases and transaction fees
* A browser — desktop or mobile

***

Salatto represents a shift from **operator-controlled lotteries** to **creator-owned game economies**.&#x20;

Whether you play or create — the rules are always transparent, the outcomes always fair.
