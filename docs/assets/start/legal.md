**Age requirement:** Users must be 18 years or older to participate. By connecting a wallet, you confirm that you meet the minimum age requirement in your jurisdiction.

**Restricted jurisdictions:** Salatto may not be available in all regions. Users are responsible for ensuring that participation in on-chain lotteries and games is permitted under their local laws.

**KYC / AML:** Salatto currently operates on a wallet-based, non-custodial model. KYC is not required at this stage. If regulatory requirements change, KYC processes may be introduced in the future — users will be notified in advance.
