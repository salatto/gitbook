#### Games & Tickets

**How do tickets work?** Each game has a fixed number of tickets at a set price. Buying a ticket enters you into the draw. When the game completes, winners are selected using on-chain VRF randomness.

**What types of games are available?** Currently, Salatto supports only classic lotteries. Jackpot pools, and instant games are planned for future releases.

**What happens if a lottery doesn't sell out?** If a game fails to meet its minimum participation requirements, it is automatically **refunded**. All funds are returned to participants. The creator earns nothing.

**Can I get a refund after buying a ticket?** You can sell your ticket back before the draw, but a 15% early exit fee applies. If the game is refunded due to insufficient participation, you receive a full refund (minus Solana network fees).

**What is the game lifecycle?** Creator publishes → tickets go on sale → game fills or timer expires → VRF selects winner → prizes distributed automatically.

#### Fairness & Trust

**Is this rigged? Can anyone manipulate the outcome?** No. All outcomes are determined by on-chain Verifiable Random Function (VRF) technology. Neither Salatto, creators, nor any third party can predict or influence results. Every draw is publicly verifiable.

**Can creators scam users?** No. Creators define game parameters before launch, but all rules are locked and immutable once the game goes live. Creators cannot change odds, manipulate randomness, or interfere with payouts.

**Can Salatto block my funds or withdrawals?** No. Salatto is non-custodial. Funds in active games are held in on-chain contracts, and payouts are automated. Salatto cannot freeze, block, or redirect your winnings.

**What happens if Salatto shuts down?** Funds in active game contracts remain on-chain. Completed games have already distributed payouts. Active games would follow their programmed logic (completion or refund).

#### Economics

**Why did I lose?** Lotteries are probability-based. Each ticket has a known chance of winning, disclosed before purchase. Not every ticket wins — that's the nature of a lottery.

**Can I lose more than I spend?** No. Your maximum loss is the price of the ticket(s) you purchased. There is no leverage, margin, or additional risk.

**Can RTP change after I buy a ticket?** No. RTP and all game economics are locked at the time of game publication. No retroactive changes are possible.

**What is the platform fee?** Salatto takes a 5% fee from the prize pool of successfully completed games. There are no fees on failed/refunded games, and no withdrawal fees.

#### Technical

**What blockchain does Salatto use?** Salatto runs on Solana — chosen for its low transaction costs, fast confirmation times, and native VRF support.

**Which wallets are supported?** Phantom, Solflare, Backpack, and other Solana-compatible wallets.

**What tokens can I use?** SOL and select SPL tokens, depending on the game. Supported tokens are shown on each game page.
