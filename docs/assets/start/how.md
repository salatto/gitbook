* Flexible RTP&#x20;
* Number of tickets per lottery
* Game lifecycle
* What happens if lottery fails / not filled

#### Randomness

Salatto uses provably fair randomness (VRF-based).

This ensures:

* equal chance for every ticket

#### Flexible RTP

Some games may have variable RTP ranges.

Important:

* no retroactive changes
* all logic is deterministic

### Platform Economics

#### Fees

* Platform fee is taken only from successful games - 5%
* No hidden fees
* Paid buttons&#x20;
* Promoting live lotteries

If a game does not reach minimum participation:

* funds are returned automatically
* creator earns nothing
