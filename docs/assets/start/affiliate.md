# Affiliate / Partners

**Salatto's** affiliate program allows creators, influencers, communities, and platforms to earn by driving participation to the Salatto ecosystem.

***

#### How It Works

Affiliates receive a unique referral link. When users sign up or participate in games through that link, the affiliate earns rewards based on the activity generated.

**Key mechanics:**

* **Traffic attribution** — each referral link tracks sign-ups and game participation from your audience
* **Reward structure** — affiliates earn a share of platform fees generated by referred users
* **Transparent tracking** — all referral activity is visible in your affiliate dashboard
* **No minimum audience** — anyone can apply, from solo creators to large communities

***

#### Who Can Participate

* Content creators and influencers
* Crypto communities and DAOs
* Streamers and media platforms
* Lottery and gaming affiliates
* Anyone with an audience interested in fair, transparent games

***

#### Featured Priority

High-performing affiliates may receive:

* Featured placement on the Salatto homepage
* Priority listing for their created games
* Co-marketing opportunities with the Salatto team
* Early access to new features and game types

Featured priority is based on quality of traffic, conversion rates, and community engagement — not just volume.

* Self-referral and circular referral schemes are prohibited
* Fake traffic, bots, and misleading promotions result in immediate disqualification
