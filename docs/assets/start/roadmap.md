# Roadmap

Salatto's development follows a phased approach — starting with a focused MVP and expanding into a full-scale LottoFi ecosystem.

***

#### Phase 1 — MVP Launch

> The foundation. Core lottery mechanics live on Solana mainnet.

**Status: Live**

* Core lottery creation and participation
* Provably fair draws via on-chain VRF randomness
* Wallet-based authentication (Phantom, Solflare, Backpack via Privy)
* Real-time prize pool visibility
* Instant automated payouts to winner wallets
* Creator and player dashboards
* Basic rank progression system (7 tiers, based on games played)

***

#### Phase 2 — Product & Engagement

> Expanding game types, creator tools, and player engagement.

**Status: In development**

New Game Types:

* Jackpot Pool — monthly shared prize pool across participating lotteries
* No-Loss Lottery — 25/50/75% cashback tiers for losing participants
* Scratch Cards (Heart Stoppers) — instant-win VRF cards
* Flexible lotteries — games that complete without 100% completion
* Sweepstakes — giveaway-style VRF draws

Creator Tools:

* Promote system (scrolling text, ad blocks, sticker frames)
* Creator Rating (CR) and Death Game Rate (DG) metrics — public reputation scores
* Creator verification system (Verified ✅)
* Creator Leaderboards

Player Engagement:

* Achievements and milestone system
* Profile badge display
* Daily/weekly quests
* Improved category clustering
* Enhanced onboarding and UX improvements
* Leveling and progression mechanics
* Promo codes and consolation prizes
* Guilds and community features

***

#### Phase 3 — Token & DeFi Expansion

> Introducing the SLTO token and DeFi mechanics.

* **SLTO token (maybe)** launch with deflationary mechanics tied to lottery activity, staking, and fees — native ecosystem token
* **Deflationary mechanics** — Jackpot pool processing fees directed to token buyback/liquidity
* **Mystery Box / Looting system** — reward boxes for milestones
* **Creator and influencer** incentives for content creation and platform promotion
* **Growing mechanics (gamified staking)** — plant seeds, grow vegetables, harvest for lottery boosts or secondary market sale
* **Consolation prizes / promo codes** — losers receive partner promo codes or creator-provided rewards
* **Clan and Guilds** — syndicate groups of players pooling tickets for Jackpot participation, shared rewards split by contribution (similar to mining pool mechanics)
* **Clan competitions** — guild vs guild metrics (volume, wins, games created) for exclusive prizes
* **Creator Wars** — weekly creator rankings with prizes
* **VRF-powered mini-games** (Flip, Pump, Rocket, Snake, and more)
* **Flip Tournaments** (16 to 1024 players)
* **API & embeddable widgets** for third-party sites and streamers

***

#### Phase 4 — Multi-Chain & Scalability

> Expanding beyond Solana and crypto-native users.

* **Fiat payment integrations** alongside crypto
* **Multi-chain expansion**: TON, Aptos, Sui, Polygon, Appchain (maybe)
* **Telegram WebApp** — full platform accessible via Telegram bot
* **TON wallet integration** — direct Telegram wallet support
* **Non-monetary prize lotteries** — physical goods, NFTs, courses, meet-and-greets, collectibles
* **New creator verticals:** meme coin creators, subscription-based lotteries, and more
* **Meme coin creator mechanics** — lottery + liquidity pool staking with token lock
* **Winner certificates** — verifiable proof of winnings for financial institutions
* **Donations/Crowdfunding lotteries** — portion of ticket sales directed to charitable causes
* **Mass adoption campaigns** — bridge non-crypto users through familiar lottery mechanics

***

#### Development Philosophy

Salatto follows a deliberate progression:

1. **Prove the core** — lottery mechanics that work, pay instantly, and are provably fair
2. **Grow engagement** — features that make players stay and creators compete
3. **Add economics** — token, staking, and DeFi layers that create a sustainable ecosystem
4. **Scale distribution** — multi-chain, fiat, Telegram, and real-world reach
5. **Go mainstream** — bridge to non-crypto audiences through familiar products and partnerships

> Each phase builds on the traction and learnings of the previous one. Features are shipped when ready, not on fixed dates.
