# Overview

**A Creator-Driven Lottery & Gaming Platform**

***

**Salatto** is a next-generation **UGC lottery and creator gaming platform** that transforms lotteries from closed, operator-controlled systems into an open, transparent, and creator-powered ecosystem.

***

Salatto enables **any creator** to design, launch, and scale their own lotteries, while players participate in games they fully understand, trust, and choose deliberately. Salatto combines creator economics, marketplace dynamics, and provably fair mechanics into a single, scalable platform.

> The Mission: To reshape on-chain lotteries by building open, transparent, equitable, and decentralized lottery games.

***

\
**From Centralized Lotteries to Open Gaming Markets**

Traditional lottery systems are built around rigid operators, fixed rules, delayed payouts, and opaque mechanics. Innovation is slow, incentives are misaligned, and users are reduced to passive participants.

Salatto introduces a new model:

* **Creators** act as independent game publishers
* **Players** choose games based on clear rules and visible odds
* **The platform** operates as neutral infrastructure, not a game controller

> This shifts lotteries from a **closed product** into an **open marketplace**.

***

\
**Designed for Viral Distribution**

Salatto is built with viral mechanics at its foundation:

* Creators promote their own games
* Each lottery is a standalone shareable product
* Success scales through community, not platform spending

{% hint style="info" %}
Every game becomes a **distribution channel**.
{% endhint %}

***

\
**Marketplace Economics**

Salatto operates as a gaming marketplace where incentives are aligned:

* **Creators** earn by building fair and attractive games
* **Players** win through clear and verifiable mechanics
* **The platform** grows through volume and trust, not manipulation

{% hint style="info" %}
Anyone can be a winner, regardless of who enters.
{% endhint %}

***

**Beyond Gambling**

Salatto is **not** designed to replicate casinos or legacy lotteries.

Its mission is to:

* Make lottery mechanics understandable and verifiable
* Remove artificial restrictions, payout delays, and forced jackpot splitting
* Empower creators instead of operators
* Build long-term trust through on-chain transparency

> Salatto represents a shift from **operator-controlled gambling** to **creator-owned game economies**.
